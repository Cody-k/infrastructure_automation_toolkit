# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-28

### Complete Sophisticated Implementation

**DevOps utilities (1,199 LOC)**

### Added

**Container Management:**
- Async Docker operations with python-docker SDK
- Detailed stats parsing (CPU delta, memory, network I/O, block I/O)
- Container lifecycle operations (start, stop, restart, pause, unpause)
- Health check monitoring with failing streak tracking
- Log retrieval
- Port and network inspection
- Cleanup automation (stopped containers, dangling images)

**Resource Analysis:**
- 24-hour historical trend tracking with persistence
- Linear regression for trend calculation
- Volatility analysis (coefficient of variation)
- Direction detection (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Predictive forecasting with time-to-threshold
- 7-day and 30-day resource projections
- Confidence scoring based on data stability

**System Monitoring:**
- Comprehensive metrics with psutil (CPU, memory, swap, disk, network)
- Per-core CPU usage
- Detailed memory stats (active, inactive, cached, buffers)
- Network interface tracking
- Top processes by CPU and memory
- Disk partition analysis
- Load average monitoring
- Threshold checking with configurable limits

**Alert System:**
- Severity-based alerts (info, low, medium, high, critical)
- Alert persistence and deduplication
- Acknowledgment tracking
- Automatic cleanup of old alerts

**Smart Recommendations:**
- Priority-based suggestions (critical, high, medium, low)
- Memory, disk, and container overhead analysis
- Actionable optimization steps with impact assessment

### Testing
- 31 comprehensive tests (all passing)
- Docker manager tests (4 tests)
- System monitor tests (7 tests)
- Resource analyzer tests (8 tests)
- Alert manager tests (8 tests)
- Optimizer tests (4 tests)

### Technologies
- psutil for system metrics
- docker SDK for container management
- dataclasses for structured data
- Type hints throughout
- JSON persistence

### Background
- Patterns from 7-node homelab (11 containers, 6+ weeks uptime)
